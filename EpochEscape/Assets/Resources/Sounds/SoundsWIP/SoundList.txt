This is the tentative list of all sounds in the project, excluding music, listed with file name and description.
The enumerations will be minus signs (-) when the sound has yet to be implemented into the game, and plus signs
	(+) when they are.
Even after a sound has been implemented, it will still be subject to polishing, in which case, the sound file
	will be updated in a Git commit, to be updated in all clones of the project.
Sounds that begin with *Pre* have a different version for each playable character, and *Pre* is replaced by the
	character's prefix in the acutal filenames.
No one is allowed to change the contents of ->Assets->Sounds without contacting me first.

*New:  In the sound asset folder, sounds that are in a usable state have an underscore (_) preceding their name.
