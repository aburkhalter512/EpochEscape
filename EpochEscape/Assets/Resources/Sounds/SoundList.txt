This is the list of sounds I expect we'll need, which I'll post in this folder as I get something useful.

Everything in the folder is to be considered WIP.  I'll begin by getting all sounds thrown together before
	working to improve their quality for the final product.

Music will be written as the art direction nears completion. The SFX will evolve to match the final art style.
